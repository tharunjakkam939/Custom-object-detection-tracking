# DRDO Internship â€” Deep Learning Fundamentals, Custom Object Detection & Tracking

This repository contains the work completed during my 6â€“8 week summer internship at the **Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)**, AI Division, Hyderabad.  
The project covers deep learning fundamentals, neural network architectures, custom object detection using YOLOv7, and real-time object tracking with re-identification using DeepSORT.


## ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights
- Studied and implemented concepts of **Neural Networks, CNNs, Gradient Descent, and evaluation metrics**.
- Developed a **custom object detection model** using YOLOv7, trained on a self-annotated dataset.
- Implemented **real-time multi-object tracking** using the DeepSORT algorithm.
- Integrated **person re-identification** so individuals maintain the same ID even after leaving and re-entering the frame.
- Used **Google Colab** for training and experimentation.



## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **/src** â€” Python scripts for YOLOv7 training, detection, and tracking.
- **/notebooks** â€” Google Colab / Jupyter notebooks for experiments and demos.
- **/outputs** â€” Sample detection and tracking results (images/videos).
- **/datasets** â€” Dataset instructions (dataset not included for confidentiality).
- **requirements.txt** â€” Python dependencies.
- **Internship_Report.pdf** â€” Detailed internship report.
