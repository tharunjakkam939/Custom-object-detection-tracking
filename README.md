# DRDO Internship ‚Äì Deep Learning, Object Detection & Tracking

This repository contains my work from a 6‚Äì8 week internship at the **AI Division, DRDO Hyderabad**.  
I explored deep learning fundamentals and built real-time object detection and tracking systems using **YOLOv7** and **DeepSORT**.

## üìù My Project Story
When I started this internship, I had some Python and basic machine learning knowledge, but deep learning felt like a black box.  
I began by learning how images are stored in memory, how neural networks process them, and why activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions matter.

Then I moved to practical work:
1. Learned **R-CNN** and **YOLO** for object detection.
2. Created and annotated a **custom dataset**, then trained **YOLOv7**.
3. Integrated **DeepSORT** for multi-object tracking with consistent IDs.
4. Implemented **person re-identification** so the system could recognize the same person after they left and re-entered the frame.

Seeing the tracking system work in real time ‚Äî with smooth bounding boxes, stable IDs, and re-identification ‚Äî was the most rewarding moment.
